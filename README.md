# Link-prediction-in-Sign-Network
Links in Signed social networks have + or - sign. Link prediction in sign networks faced with complexity such as unbalanced data.
In sign networks positive sign exist much more than Negative sign, therefore sign of links have skew distribution.
This project predict sign of link in social network using features extracted from network.
